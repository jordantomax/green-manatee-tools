# Shippo Multi-Piece Shipments

This is a wrapper around the Shippo API to allow multi-piece shipments.  It allows users to enter their API key and to create a multi-piece shipment based on dimensions and weight of their packages. It could be easily altered to allow greater control over your shipment by adding other pieces of metadata. Please file an issue if you would like to see specific changes. Contributors are also welcome!
